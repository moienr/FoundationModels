# Generative AI, Foundation Models and Large Language Models

## Introduction
In this repository, I will save my work on Generative AI, Foundation Models and Large Language Models. 



## Videos

IBM Technology on Youtube is a great place to start.

## Repositories

[IBM NASA Geospatial](https://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial) is a foundation model trained on NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) data. It has Segmentation models like **Flood**. Their base model is called **Prithivi**. And they have various fine-tuned models like **Flood**.
